Mastermind is a difficult puzzle game, in which one player tries to guess the code their opponent comes up with. 
Originally a board game, though with roots in earlier pen-and-paper games, Mastermind is now widely available online and for mobile devices as well.[1]
You can also play Mastermind with paper and pen if you don't have the board game or video game version.

Assignment
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.
